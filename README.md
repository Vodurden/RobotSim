RobotSim
========

Welcome to the project! We're simulating a robot moving around on a 5x5 tabletop. Take a look
at PROBLEM.md for more info.

Anyway if you're interested in my thoughts read THOUGHTS.md. If you're interested in how
I arrived at this code take a look at the git history.

The project uses `sbt` so to build and run it simply:

    sbt compile
    sbt run

Input is taken from standard input. Just type the command and press enter.

To run the tests:

    sbt test
